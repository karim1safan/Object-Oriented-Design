3) Sam was asked to create a DeliveryDriver class. Sam thought about the problem, and reduced it to its most essential aspectsâ€¦ things like takeOrder,
DeliveryArea, etc. She ignored things that were not important in the context, like the driver's height or eye colour. 
She just applied an important object-oriented design principle. Which of these concepts best describes what she just did?

- generalization 
- abstraction

ANSWER: abstraction

4) Sam identified the important attributes and behaviours of a delivery driver and put them all into a DeliveryDriver class, like "takeOrder", "deliverOrder",
and "DeliveryArea." She exposed some of these to other classes. She just demonstrated an important part of object-oriented design. Which of these 
concepts best describes what you did?
- abstraction
- generalization
- decomposition
- encapsulation

ANSWER:
