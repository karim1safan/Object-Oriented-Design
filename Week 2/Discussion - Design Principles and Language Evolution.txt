Design Reviews and Refactoring:
	- Conduct regular design reviews with team members to evaluate the coupling and cohesion of your code.
	- Use refactoring techniques to improve the design by reducing coupling and increasing cohesion where necessary.

Use Design Patterns:
	- Apply design patterns such as Dependency Injection, Observer, and Strategy to decouple components and promote cohesive designs.
	- Design patterns provide proven solutions to common design problems and often lead to more maintainable and flexible code.
